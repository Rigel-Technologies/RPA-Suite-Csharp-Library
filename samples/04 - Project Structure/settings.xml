  <message>Hello %user%. I'm Cartes, the intelligent robot of RPA Suite.
This example shows how to create processes using C# libraries with Cartes.

     1 - Create a class library (.NET Framework) with a class to handle the application.
         Inherited from MyCartesAPIBase.
         
     2 - Create a Windows Forms application (.NET Framework) and delete the form. Create a
         class that implements the process, inherited from MyCartesProcessBase.
